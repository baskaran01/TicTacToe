# 🎮 Java Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple **console-based Tic Tac Toe game** implemented in Java. This project demonstrates core Java programming concepts such as arrays, loops, object-oriented design, exception handling, and user input.

---

## 📌 Features

- Two-player turn-based game (X and O)
- 3x3 game board display
- Input validation and error handling
- Win condition detection for all rows, columns, and diagonals
- Draw condition handling
- Option to replay the game after each match

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or above)
- Command Line / Terminal
- No external libraries required

---

## ▶️ How to Run

### 🖥️ Compile

```bash
javac TicTacToe.java
````

### ✅ Run

```bash
java TicTacToe
```

## 🧠 Concepts Learned

* Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Methods, Encapsulation)
* 2D Arrays for grid management
* Control flow (loops, conditionals)
* Exception handling (`InputMismatchException`)
* Scanner class for user input
* Modular programming (splitting logic into reusable methods)
